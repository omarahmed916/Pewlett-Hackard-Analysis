# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Using SQL- relational databases

# Purpose of our project

The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955.


# The Results

- With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

- The unique titles table that we created is showing the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

- Our retiring_titles shows us the a majority of the employees of retirment age (57,668/90,398 = 64%) have senior titles.

- The final part of our project shows mentorship eligibility, if you look at the head of the new csv - you can see that most of these employees have senior titles.

## Pewlett Hackard Analysis Summary

90,398 roles will need to be filled as the employees begin to hit retirement age. However, we can provide additional queries to understand the impact of this more deeply. By finding the total number of employees at Pewlett Hackard, we can see the impact on the company by a percentage of how many jobs will remain filled and how many need to be filled.
